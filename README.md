# Language_analysis

The data set given is a subset of the which English data, which records multiple variables about a participant in an English test.

The questions I seek to answer regard international exposure and English language ability. By international exposure I specifically want to look at factors such as total known languages and places lived by a person, and their effect on English ability. Ability in English language will always be measured by the percentage of correct answers on the test.

To answer the first part of my question, I will be looking at if people who have a spent a portion of their lives outside an English speaking country are better at English than those who have spent their entire life in an English speaking country. The people that I will be looking at are those that have English as their native language. The variable that I will use to help me with this analysis is ‘english_country_percent.’

Answering a similar question, I will take my analysis one step further to see if there is a correlation between the number of countries someone has lived (do not necessarily have to be English speaking countries) and their English ability. For that I will edit my tibble so that I can get a numerical value for the variable ‘all_countries.’

To answer the second part of my research question, I will be performing statistical tests to see whether people that speak only English have better English ability than those that are multilingual (with English being one of their known languages).
